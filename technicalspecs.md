### Technical Specifications for the GiG token

#### The Stellar Blockchain
The GiG token will be issued on the Stellar blockchain.  [stellar.org](https://stellar.org) The Stellar blockchain was chosen for its regulatory status as a utility blockchain that is purpose-built for financial transactions. Industry giants such as Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, MoneyGram, and more use it.  

#### Native vs. Soroban Smart Contract
The Stellar blockchain currently has two options for issuing tokens.  Option one is a native asset issued on the blockchain with limited "smart" capabilities.  Option two is a Soroban Smart Contract following the Soroban Token Specification.  This option allows a token to be issued like an Ethereum ERC-20 token.  The Soroban contract can also add compliance mechanisms such as transfer restrictions, KYC and AML enforcement, and suitability restrictions.

#### Issuance
Sections D and S of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission rules regulate the issuance of the GiG token.  Guidance at this point indicates that a token issued under these regulations shall have the following attributes:
1) To satisfy regulatory agency freeze actions, the token shall be revocable or frozen by the issuer.
2) To satisfy lost or stolen tokens, the token can be clawed back from an account by the issuer.
A US-regulated broker/dealer will be required to solicit investors and distribute GiG tokens publicly. An Alternative Trading System (ATS) will be needed to trade GiG tokens publicly to comply with SEC and FINRA rules. Private transactions are subject to lesser requirements.

#### Transfer
Sections D and S of the SEC regulate the transfer of the securities.  Depending on which exemptions are used when defining the token, the GiG marketplace may implement certain transfer restrictions.  These may include but are limited to the following:
1) Country of citizenship - Reg D is for US investors, and Reg S is for non-US investors.
2) Know your customer (KYC)/KYB) - As a regulated digital security, all owners of the GiG token will be subject to KYC procedures.
3) Accreditation - Depending on the exemptions used, certain GiG holders will be have to be accredited investors.
4) Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering - GiG token holders must be subject to continued screening for BSA/AML/OFAC in the US and worldwide for Reg S tokens.
5) Age restrictions - All GiG purchases by natural persons must be 18.
6) Transfer of unrestricted tokens - The issuer must maintain a control record of ownership of the security.  This may be delegated to a Transfer Agent.
#### Trading
Trading of the GiG token may take place in a number of different ways based on the token type issued.  Trading may be facilitated on the Stellar DEX, Swapping Smart Contracts, and other dedicated platforms and contracts, depending on the transfer restrictions on the GiG token.
