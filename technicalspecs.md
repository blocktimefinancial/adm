### Technical Specifications for the GiG token

#### The Stellar Blockchain
The GiG token will be issued on the Stellar blockchain.  (Insert link to stellar.org.) The Stellar blockchain was chosen for its regulatory status as a utility blockchain, purpose-built for financial transactions. Industry giants such as Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, MoneyGram, and more use it.  

#### Native vs Soroban Smart Contract
The Stellar blockchain currently has two options for issuing tokens.  Option one is a native asset issued on the blockchain with limited "smart" capabilities.  Option two is a Soroban Smart Contract following the Soroban Token Specification.  This option allows a token to be issued in a manner sililar to an Ethereum ERC-20 token.  The Soroban contract can also add additional compliance mechanisms such as transfer restrictions, KYC and AML enforcement, and suitability restrictions.
